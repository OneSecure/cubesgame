Imagine a cuboid consisting of two cubes. Now you push it over its edges. It 'rolles' 90 degree each step to one of four directions.

This is the way you explore levels consisting of squared fields. To walk through a level its neccessary to reach a finish field vertically. On your way exiting a level you have to get around traps, beam your cuboid to different positions an take care of not dropping it over the level border.

This is much like the famous sokoban extended by a third dimension of logical movement. We also want to add a huge bunch of fancy 3D graphics, nice textures and effects to it, but thats a long way from now.

For now we just like you to remember this project in a few months to give it a try when we got something playable.
